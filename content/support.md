## What does ASHIRT do for Blue Teams?

- _It improves collaboration, allowing network defenders to see exactly what happened, when it happened, and most importantly how._
- _When the Blue Team wants to recreate an attack, structure a hunt, or build detections, ASHIRT lays an easy-to-follow timeline to reference. One Paranoids' network defender said, "It's not quite being in the attacker's shoes, but it's pretty dang close."_
